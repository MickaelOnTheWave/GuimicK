Fixed bugs :
        18/09/2017 - [002] Rsnapshot report parsing fails when parsing first backup (no weekly.1 folder)
	16/10/2017 - [006] Occasionally a test in TaskFeature test will fail. Reproduce issue, check what it is and fix it!!
	26/10/2017 - [012] Local debug option of wake job is not working.
	16/04/2018 - [009] MIME email content is still buggy - some junk chars at the end of each archive. Looks like the counting is wrong in relation with message size.
	26/09/2018 - [011] Configuration parser fails to parse empty string properties. See TODO.
	13/12/2018 - [013] Configuration Editor Backup UI : folder controls should be disabled when no selection
        15/04/2019 - [015] Jobs with same type just created are always edited together
        28/04/2019 - [016] Windows - error when trying to create a monthly scheduled run. It is in Windows API.
        05/05/2019 - [017] Windows Monthly trigger randomly fails with set.
        24/07/2019 - [018] Disk check job doesn't work by default - make it ask admin mode
        05/02/2020 - [015] Jobs are duplicated when changes are saved from Editor in Client mode.

Pending bugs :
	[001] Git report parser crashes when trying to parse a report coming from git asking for ssh password.
	[003] Rsnapshot tests need to wait before doing backup. Maybe pending file operations need to be flushed before?
	[004] Rsnapshot job created from SmartCreator leaves configuration file behind. Change its design to clean everything (and check while writing to not overwrite an existing one!!)
	[005] Some bad configurations make app crash. See confbackuponly.txt in Synology.
	[007] Rsnapshot fails at ignoring unmodified files in tests. Create/modify tests to fit this test case.
	[008] Git FS backup doesn't work with first data report (git diff command).
	[010] Some tests are failing in GitJob only in Release. Make all test suites pass 100% in both Debug and Release.
	[012] Debug flag is not handled as it should. Check that global one works as default and can be overridden by local ones.
        [014] There should be error reporting when simple copy backup fails (see on windows, using system folder)
        [016] Local shutdown not working on Windows for Standalone mode
        [017] Client name sometimes get random string content
        [018] Installer takes bad dlls from windeployqt when several Qt versions are installed
        [019] Software isn't reported in Applications list in Windows 10
