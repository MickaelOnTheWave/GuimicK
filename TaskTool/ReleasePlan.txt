Fixed bugs :

Pending bugs :
	[001] Git report parser crashes when trying to parse a report coming from git asking for ssh password.
	[002] Rsnapshot report parsing fails when parsing first backup (no weekly.1 folder)
	[003] Rsnapshot tests need to wait before doing backup. Maybe pending file operations need to be flushed before?
	[004] Rsnapshot job created from SmartCreator leaves configuration file behind. Change its design to clean everything (and check while writing to not overwrite an existing one!!)
	[005] Some bad configurations make app crash. See confbackuponly.txt in Synology.
	[006] Occasionally a test in TaskFeature test will fail. Reproduce issue, check what it is and fix it!!
		- Issue happens more on Release, with other failures in Git test suites. Resolve all of them.
	[007] Rsnapshot fails at ignoring unmodified files in tests. Create/modify tests to fit this test case.
